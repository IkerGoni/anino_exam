Improvements

Event handler class. So classes don't need to know about each other. Just trigger events/listen to events on a list of events there.
Helps decoupling classes and cuts dependencies. Didn't do bc of time constrains.

Finish the code to accept different size reels. Code is directed and prepared for that on a degree

UI controller is "dirty" and implemented fast just to make it work. Use of events would be better to update it than the current system.

UI -> separate static and not static images/texts. Improve performance as not need to make all dirty and render again.

Better audio system. Is simple and just made for the purpose of the test. Doesn't have system to stop audio, have loops, audio mixers. Definately to improve in a better proyect.
